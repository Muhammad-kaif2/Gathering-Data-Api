# Gathering-Data-Api
This repository demonstrates how to connect to public and private APIs, retrieve structured data (JSON, XML, CSV), and transform it into usable formats such as pandas DataFrames for analysis. Includes examples of API authentication, pagination handling, and combining multiple API sources into a single dataset.
